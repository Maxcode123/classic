# Lexer  
A lexical analyzer or lexer is a function that receives a stream of characters and returns a stream of predefined tokens. The lexer function used for the _classic_ compiler is generated by [Flex](https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/flex-2.5.4/flex.html). `classical.lex` contains all the configuration that is used by Flex to generate the lexer function.  
The generated lexer is a C module named `lex.yy.c`.

## Build the lexer
To generate the lexer module with Flex run `make flex`, this command will create the `lex.yy.c` file.  
To build the whole lexer run `make lexer`.

## Run the lexer
Run `make run-lexer` to run the lexer. This wil by default feed the `tests/test.classic` file to the lexer. You can modify this file as you'd like, to observe the lexer's output and experiment with different programs written in _classic_.
